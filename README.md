# 3P-Satellite-Structure
The 3P Satellite adheres rigorously to ESA guidelines and ECSS Standards, embodying precision in design and adherence to constraints. With dimensions of 178 * 50 * 50 mm³ and a mass of 450g, the satellite features a structured frame, including a sliding backplate (178 * 50 mm²), three side panels, and two top and bottom panels, all with a 0.75 mm thickness. Panels are interconnected by 1.25 mm brackets along vertical sides, enhancing structural integrity.
Material: Aluminium 6061 is chosen for its availability, strength, and cost-effectiveness. The x-cross section design, coupled with horizontal supports, ensures a lightweight yet robust structure. The centre of mass, critical for stability, is meticulously kept within 1 cm in the stowed position. Adherence to broader constraints is evident; any material not specified requires consultation with the Launch Service Provider. Metallic materials in contact with the deployer and standoffs undergo hard anodization. Baseplate material recommendations include FR4 or specific Aluminium grades (7075, 6061, 6065, 6082). Structural materials undergo rigorous environmental testing.

Mass & Position: Each 3P PocketQube adheres to a 750g mass limit, ensuring compatibility with standards. Safety is a priority, with kill switches exclusively on the Z-axis. Placement options include the lateral side within 20 mm from Z-faces, touching deployment rails, or aligned with the sliding backplate in Z-face, contacting the PocketQube below or the pusher plate. Kill switches do not obstruct ejection.

Considered Computational Analysis: Structural simulations were performed to analyse stress distribution and deformation under various loads and conditions, ensuring the satellites robustness during launch and in orbit. Concurrently, modal simulations were performed to assess natural frequencies and vibration responses, for understanding the PocketQube Sat's dynamic behaviour.

Structural Analysis: For Structural Simulations, extruded legs at the bottom represent the fixed support that will make contact with the P-Pod's lower boundary. Vertical as well as Side Tension Test was simulated which showed that the structure can withstand mechanical loads, ensuring material integrity for using Aluminium 6061.

Modal Analysis: A spring-loaded deployment mechanism is used in the P-POD.This spring-loaded design allows for a very small amount of vertical movement during launch, while the side rails keep the satellite rigidly fixed in two directions. Because of this for the boundary conditions, the side of the PocketSat was constrained in all directions other than the vertical direction as it allowed the structure to warp slightly during takeoff, and will simulate the rigid sides of the P-POD.The results achieved through this simulations were satisfied as the first mode values were 704 Hz which is much greater than major forcing amplitudes in launch vehicles that occur below 100Hz.
